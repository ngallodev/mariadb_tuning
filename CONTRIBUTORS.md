## Collaboration Model

This project uses a dual-AI workflow:
- **Claude Code**: Primary development and testing
- **Codex**: Code review, validation, and refinement

Each contributor is identified in `task_status.log` with their signature:
- Entries ending with `- Claude` were completed by Claude Code
- Entries ending with `- Codex` were completed by Codex

## Acknowledgments
