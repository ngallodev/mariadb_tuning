## MONITORING TASKS

### Task 1: Verify soharaa Removal from GitHub Contributors
Priority: MEDIUM
Status: MONITORING (GitHub cache may take up to 24 hours)
Last Action: 2025-10-16 08:35Z

**Background:**
The GitHub user "soharaa" (Simon Ohara) was incorrectly appearing as a contributor because:
- We added `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>` to a commit
- That email is associated with the GitHub user "soharaa"

**Actions Completed:**
- ✓ Removed all `Co-Authored-By: Codex <noreply@openai.com>` lines from git history
- ✓ Rewrote git history using git filter-branch
- ✓ Force-pushed cleaned history to GitHub (af5c058)
- ✓ Updated CONTRIBUTORS.md to remove Codex/ChatGPT
- ✓ Updated README.md to remove Codex/ChatGPT
- ✓ Updated .mailmap to remove OpenAI mapping
- ✓ Verified local git history is clean (only ngallodev and Claude commits)

**What to Check:**
Visit https://github.com/ngallodev/mariadb_tuning/graphs/contributors
- Should show only 2 contributors: ngallodev and claude
- If soharaa still appears, wait 24 hours for GitHub cache to clear
- If still present after 24 hours, may need to contact GitHub support

**Note:** Local repository is completely clean. This is purely a GitHub caching issue.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (Lower Priority)

### Add Trap Handlers to bulk_load.sh
Issue: Ctrl+C leaves server in extreme mode
Solution: Add trap handler to always restore conservative mode
Reference: codex.md, CLAUDE.md
Status: Not started

### Add State Snapshotting
Issue: Scripts restore hard-coded values, not original settings
Solution: Capture actual values before changing them
Reference: codex.md lines 30-34
Status: Not started

### Quote SQL Identifiers
Issue: SQL injection risk with database/table names
Solution: Use backticks around identifiers
Reference: codex.md line 14
Status: Not started

### Fix mariadb_status.sh Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Ignores MYSQL_OPTS parameter
Solution: Use MYSQL_CMD="mariadb $MYSQL_OPTS"
Reference: mariadb_status.sh:20, codex.md line 19
Status: Not started

## IMPORTANT CONVENTIONS

### Task Status Log Signatures
**ALWAYS add signature** when logging toagent_files/task_status.log:
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ | tag | description - Claude`
- Example: `2025-10-16 08:45Z | testing | Added new tests - Claude`

### File Ownership
**DO NOT change file ownership** - keep all files as `nate:nate`
- Use `sudo bash -c 'command'` for root-owned files if needed
- Never use `chown` unless explicitly requested

### Testing Philosophy
- Integration tests > Unit tests
- Condense redundant tests
- Test real behavior, not every edge case
- Current: ~120 tests (92 unit + 28 integration)
